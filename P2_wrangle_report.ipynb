WeRateDogs is a twitter account that rates peoples dogs and consists of funny comments. it is also rated by a numerator and denominator."

    "**Gather**\n",
    "I had to gather data which was given on Udacity platform the first was `` Twitter_archive_file`` which was a csv file. the second was ''Image with predictions of a neural network and this file is  `(image_predictions.tsv)``. and the last was Twitter Api/Json file, i used he Json file as i was unable to access Twitter Api.\n",

    "**Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "i used the programmatic method of assessing data mostly, with pandas function and methods. After which i divided the issues of the data into 2 parts namely; Quality and Tidiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clean**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here i was able to identify issues in the dataframe, which ranged from ``(duplicates, inconsistency in the data, values filled with Non, Non-descriptive Column names amongst others)``.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualize**\n",
    "\n",
    "After all said and done it came down to visualization, which for me is a place of interest, plotting bars with Seaborn and python, ALthough i am still trying to get a solid grip on it.\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the classroom by David, Data Wrangling is a core skill of a Data Scientist/Analyst, and is probably the most technical accept of the field. To cut to the chase, i have learnt the importance of investigating a dataset properly, the patience required and alot of codes to learn."
